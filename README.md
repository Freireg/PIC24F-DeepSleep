# PIC24F-DeepSleep

* A PIC24F deep sleep example:
  * Deep Sleep is a power saving mode built-in the PIC microcontrollers;
  * To enter this state, the MCU need to do a sequence of commands;
  * There are many ways to exit this operation mode, but in this example the exit method is via EXTIT (while  maintaining a DSWDT as a fail-safe).
